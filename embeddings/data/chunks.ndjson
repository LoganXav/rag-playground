The number of calories in a food item is a measure of how much potential energy that food possesses. For example: 1g of carbohydrates has 4 calories 1g of protein has 4 calories 1g of fat has 9 calories Various foods are a compilation of these three building blocks.

The digestion of each food – One of my mentors would always say to me, ‘it’s not about what you eat, it’s about what you absorb’. The truth is, it’s a combination of both. Your food choices are important, but you also need to consider how much of that food you are absorbing.

Will 100g of rice from a microwave packet filled with preservatives be absorbed the same way as 100 g of pure rice that needs to be boiled and drained? The answer is ‘no.’ The removal of some fibre and the addition of preservatives, means that microwavable ready-made foods will have a significantly lower absorption rate than their non-processed alternatives, thus leaving you with less energy for the same number of calories. Further in this chapter, I will discuss how making one simple change – eliminating or greatly reducing processed foods – can have an incredibly beneficial impact on your body’s ability to burn body fat or build lean muscle."}

To cement the idea that you do not need to consume protein-rich food together in a single meal to reap the benefits of combining proteins, The University of Michigan’s reports show that, ‘Eating a variety of foods with incomplete proteins throughout the day allows your body to get the amino acids you need from diet.’ The one thing to remember is that your body doesn’t store complete proteins for a rainy day. According to the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation for Dietary Reference Intakes, ‘There is no evidence for a protein reserve that serves only as a store to meet future needs’, which means you need to stay on top of your nutrition and combine your foods every single day to reap all the benefit of essential amino acids."}

By giving you an energy boost : If there’s one thing that everyone knows about coffee and caffeinated drinks or pills is that caffeine is a pretty strong stimulant. It increases alertness and wards off drowsiness temporarily, which means you can perform certain tasks more efficiently for longer on caffeine. This applies for physical tasks as well as mental tasks. This means a little shot of caffeine can give you the energy you need to give 100% during your workout. And giving 100% in the gym means you’ll get the results you want more quickly."}

Take 30 minutes before your workout to release free fatty acids to be burnt while you train and to increase physical and mental alertness.

You have the power to take care of specific factors to make sure you’re tired when you decide to sleep.

The muscle repair occurs at night during your deep REM sleep, for which you require raw materials (amino acids) to help heal and grow new tissues. I recommend consuming a combination of a scoop of good-quality whey or vegan protein with a tablespoon of MCT oil 30 minutes before bed.

If I missed my 11:00pm window by 15 or 20 minutes, I would get this incredible second wind, which was amazing when I was eighteen or nineteen and going out to clubs, but terrible when I was in my mid-twenties and had to be up for work at 6:00am. If you can stick as close as you can to the circadian cycle and get to bed before 11:00pm, you will wake up feeling more rested than if you get the same amount of sleep starting later. I know it’s hard for some people, especially if you work night shifts, as your circadian cycle is massively disrupted. But I recommend experimenting with this trick for a week or two."}

However, training doesn’t really work like that. A funny thing happened when I started to cut my workouts from three hours to two hours and then to one hour – which is the most time I’ll dedicate to workouts now – my body composition began to change, and I started to look better! To me, it defied all logic – surely three hours is better than one, right?

When you weight train or work for resistance in general, using body weight, dumbbells, bands or barbells, etc., you tear more muscle fibres. These fibres need repairing after every workout, for which they use calories from the food and amino acids from protein. Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout."}

However, you also need to do it right. When you hear people talking about their ‘form’, it’s actually just the way you do the movement. If you do a barbell bent over row with a curved back, that’s considered ‘bad form’, which basically means that you’re not performing the movement the correct way. As you are not swinging the weight from A to B, the beauty of tension training and 2:1:2 systems means you can focus on creating the tension on every single rep.

Low intensity steady state (LISS) is exactly as it sounds – it’s low in intensity. For example, a 15-minute steady pace walk, jog or cycle where you are at or above 70% of your max heart rate. Note: 70% of your max heart rate is your ‘fat-burning zone’ – to calculate your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are 28, it would be 220 minus 28, which is 192."}

LISS is a good tool if your diet is clean – your carbs are low and you’re eating regular meals throughout the day alongside your weight-training program.

Its negatives are that it’s difficult. And when done correctly, very difficult!

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time.

The key is to go as hard as possible for 30 seconds and then completely rest or recover for the next 30 seconds.

Reps : The number of repetitions you will do, the number of times you will perform the movements. For example, if you do the movement 10 times, that’s 10 reps. Sets: The number of sets is the number of ‘rounds’ you do. For example, if you do 3 sets of 10 reps, you perform 10 reps of the exercise with a 2:1:2 tempo and then rest for 60 seconds. Repeat for your second and third set. Rest: The amount of time you rest in between sets. Tension: All the reps are at a tension of 2:1:2. Two seconds on the positive (the upward motion), one second squeeze (at the top or bottom depending on the exercise) and two seconds on the negative (the downward motion)."}

Cardio: All the cardio in this program is based on HIIT. HIIT burns more calories, takes less time and works incredibly well to elevate metabolism while burning fat when incorporated into a tension styled program. I personally like using the rowing machine or a stationary bike, but HIIT can be done on any cardio machine. HIIT: For HIIT training, set a level that you can sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds."}

Becoming self-aware of your negative behaviour, patterns and habits isn’t always that easy to recognize. That’s why reading certain books is crucial, as they can ‘point’ things out in a way that we may have missed or failed to see.

This of course eventually led to me consuming a lot of stimulated drinks or eating sugary food the following day to try and pick myself up. This cycle would ultimately keep me awake again the following night. Every week, I would count down until Friday, so I could sleep in at the weekend and not set an alarm. Of course, the anxiety would subside every Friday evening, and I would stay awake until I was tired and then sleep right through the night."}

If I felt I was on the edge, I never dealt with it or asked myself who or what was making me feel this way. I just went to the gym. I was effectively ‘self-medicating’ with exercise. In my opinion, it’s actually the best way to reduce short, as well as long- term anxiety, but it’s imperative to follow step one and then use training, exercise and meditation as ways to support you and not just put a lid over the real problem."}

Don’t eat foods that make your anxiety worse This really could have been number one, but as it’s discussed in more detail in the nutrition section, it is number three on the list.

I remember reading The Will Power Instinct by Kelly McGonigal, where she talks about how it takes willpower to say ‘no’ to things and how to be present with the people you care about the most. If you want a better relationship with someone, be it your partner, your parents or your children, be present when you are with them. The book talks about a study done on husbands and fathers who were physically present at home for at least six hours a day, but spent the entire time either watching TV or working."}
